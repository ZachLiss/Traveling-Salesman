list of .java files:
MyDemonstrateTSP.java
Map.java
Tour.java
City.java

to run:
just compile and run MyDemonstrateTSP.java

problems:
the program will run fine with a smaller amount of cities... up to 50 or so. 
Once the number of stops gets higher my 2-opt starts to have trouble finding a single solution.
I couldn't figure out a way to create a loop that would solve that problem.
